# EM GaussianMixture & HMM

### Python implementations of EM methods to mixture of Gaussian and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with Gaussian hidden states.
### The convergence condition is log-likelihood.
### For Hidden Markov Model forward and backward normalization process and approximated log-likelihood function, please check
